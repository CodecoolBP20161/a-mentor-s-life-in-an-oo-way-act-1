# Description

This file contains the story of our average mentor's day.

### ```The beginning```
In the morning the mentor check the energy level of the student are low or high. If low, then he's organising an improvisational football championship.

After if everyone is happy and full of energy let's get down to business.


### ```During the day```

When the students need an example, the mentor turns on the projector and the laptop to try to show them a solution.

### ```When the students ready to leave```
When a student or an other mentor needs a feedback, the mentor helps her/him. But if the mentor is the one who needs feedback, a student give him.


### ```It's time to check CANVAS```

At the end of the day, it's time to check the assignments of the students in CANVAS. The most important thing is the assignment is received or not, so the mentor needs to check that first.
